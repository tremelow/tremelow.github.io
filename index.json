The solutions of such problems present two dynamics which are intertwined\\: a relaxation of characteristic time Œµ, and a slow part of interactions or transport. Since the 1980s, efficient and stable methods have been developed to solve these problems numerically, however one issue remains: the accuracy of the method degrades when the time-step is of size Œµ. In this work, we present a method to overcome this limit. Our approach consists in performing asymptotic developments with relation to Œµ to construct an non-stiff asymptotic model and its error. We then consider this asymptotic behavior and the error separately -‚Äì this is a micro-macro decomposition. This new problem may be solved and the solution of the original problem recovered, all with an accuracy independent of Œµ. As our asymptotic developments use results from averaging, a chapter of this work is dedicated to averaging results. Specifically, we present original proofs of known results, using recent frameworks which make algebraic reasonings straightforward. A brief discussion surrounding possible extensions of our results is conducted at the end of the manuscript.

Such models appear for instance in population dynamics or propagation phenomena. We develop a multi-scale approach by splitting the equations into a micro part and a macro part, from which the original stiffness has been removed. We then show that both parts can be simulated numerically with *uniform* order of accuracy using *standard explicit* numerical schemes. As a result, solving the problem in its micro-macro formulation can be done with a cost and an accuracy *independent of the stiffness*. This work is also a preliminary step towards the application of such methods to hyperbolic partial differential equations and we will indeed demonstrate that our approach can be successfully applied to two discretized hyperbolic systems (with and without non-linearities), though with some ad-hoc regularization.","tags":["multi-scale","micro-macro","uniform accuracy","relaxation"],"title":" A uniformly accurate numerical method for a class of dissipative systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L√©opold Tr√©mant","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
